# Iris_Data_Visualization-Project

Hello Guys!!!

The Iris Project is a data visualization project. It involves the most basic data visualization function. Being beginner freindly I would suggest my fellow Machine Learning enthusiasts to have a look at this. Data visualization is considered to be the first step into any machine learning problem statement. It allows you to view the positioning of the data points and thus hints you the best model for any given problem statement. The given project invloves concepts from two main python libraries Mathplotlib and Seborn. It gives you an overview of the few main data visualization functions which are widely used namely: 1)PairPlot 2)Histogram 3)ViolinPlot 4)BoxPlot 5)ScatterMatrix 6)Heatmap

These plots will surely give you a clear cut idea about the model to be used in your machine learning model. It will familiarize you with the data visualizaton techniques!

# Happy Learning Guys!!
